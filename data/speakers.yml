    Every programmer wants to write Good Code, but what does that actually mean? Almost anyone who has been in the industry for more than a few years will have seen horrible abuse of model-view-controller, so it is perhaps no wonder that we are quick to reach for design patterns as a panacea. We want to future-proof in case we need to switch ORMs or move away from our chosen framework altogether, and so we isolate and we interface; we reach for domain-driven design and hexagonal architecture and the Gang of Four. We are making many of our applications far more complex than they really need to be to solve problems that may never exist. In this talk, we'll explore the difference between proactive and reactive coding, re-evaluating along the way some practices that many programmers have declared 'cardinal sins.'

    Octopus Deploy is a tool for .NET deployment automation. You can use it to deploy IIS websites, Windows services, and even certificates and scripts that you need to run on remote machines. Octopus Deploy has the potential to make deploying from the build server to remote machines painless and repeatable- but there are some things you may want to know up front to make that happen. This session will explore why you might want to try Octopus Deploy, what sort of issues you may run into, and how Ocuvera uses Octopus to manage our on-premise product installations & updates.
